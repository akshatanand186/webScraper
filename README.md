# webScraper

This is a simple project wherein I tried to extract the external links and the titles of Questions in the [Striver's SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) so that I can put them into a separate Sheet and my friends and I can maintain a common [LeaderBoard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u21GYWJvWNUSNYvUh9-WnEXJzF2j9K6rZswBKQdsLFY/edit#gid=0).

## How to Install and Run the Project
Install NodeJS on your system

Download the code.
Run
```bash
npm install
```
Then run
```
node index.js
```

## Usage

The strings str1, str2, and tit store the links(1 and 2) and the titles respectively.
You can output it in other text file or make a spreadsheet using these outputs.
